Package: NDTr
Title: The Neural Decoding Toolbox in R
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Ethan", "Meyers", email = "emeyers@hampshire.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A package that allows one to do a neural decoding analysis in R. 
  The package is based on 4 abstract object types: datasources (DS), features preprocessors (FP), 
  classifiers (CL), and cross-validators (CV). By combing different versions of these 4 object
  types together, it is possible to run a range of different decoding analyses. See www.readout.info
  for more information.
