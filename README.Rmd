##Description:
A package that allows one to do a neural decoding analysis in R. 
  The package is based on 4 abstract object types: datasources (DS), features preprocessors (FP), 
  classifiers (CL), and cross-validators (CV). By combing different versions of these 4 object
  types together, it is possible to run a range of different decoding analyses. See www.readout.info for more information. 

## Installation

You can install NDTr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Xinzhu-Fang/NDTr")
```
